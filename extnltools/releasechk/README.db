_I. FAQ_

A.
Q: WHY THE HELL?!
A: Because fetching upstream sources is surprisingly complex! You need to be
   able to change parts of the URL with each release, the filename, use an
   alternate mirror URL if the original has rate limiting, things like that.

B.
Q: Okay, but why Sqlite3/why a database?
A: A text file isn't very conducive to sectioning out and parsing those
   particular sections. We need something that contains bits of information,
   can easily have only part of that data fetched, can have multiple parts
   concatenated, sections of that easily updated, etc. Sqlite3 especially is a
   good choice because it doesn't require a binary client on the host the
   script runs on- just the python library (many distributions' python installs
   even include the sqlite3 module by default). Sqlite3 requires no running
   daemon or the like either.

C.
Q: Okay... I get it. Mutter, mutter, mutter. But how is it laid out?
A: Why, simply reference the handy schema (see: II. Schema)!

B. Detailed specification

1. Sources
a. "id"
   This column is a numerical, serialized, unique key. It's mostly handy for
   speeding up queries on the same row.

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: Must not be manually entered.

b. "package"
   The actual name of the software. This is mostly intended to be a human-
   friendly reference for the software.

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: Freeform. Recommended no whitespace or non-ASCII symbols.

c. "protocol"
   The protocol used to fetch the source. Future support may include rsync,
   sftp/scp, etc.
   e.g. Original URL: https://www.domain.tld/dir/subdir/filename-1.2.3.tar.gz
        protocol: https

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   Restrictions: Must be one of: http, https, ftp. (More may be implemented in
   future.)

d. "urlbase"
   The part of the URL/URI not including the file or protocol specifier. May
   be altered on successful fetch/check/etc. (depending on flags and if version
   string is present in URI).
   e.g. Original URL: http://www.domain.tld/dir/subdir/filename-1.2.3.tar.gz
        urlbase: www.domain.tld/dir/subdir/

   PRESNT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: Must be valid URI format (i.e. use '%20' instead of ' '). May
   be case-sensitive (depending on server's configuration).

e. "file_prefix"
   The part of the filename found before the version string.
   e.g. Original URL: http://www.domain.tld/dir/subdir/filename-1.2.3.tar.gz
        file_prefix: filename-

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: May be blank. May be case-sensitive (depending on server's
   configuration).

f. "version"
   The actual version string. This may be updated on successful fetch/check/
   etc. (depending on flags).
   e.g. Original URL: http://www.domain.tld/dir/subdir/filename-1.2.3.tar.gz
        version: 1.2.3

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: Should ideally only consist of numbers and period separators.
   If in a nonstandard version (e.g. tzdata, "YYYY[a-z]", you should use the
   'N' flag. Future versions will include support for hyphenated/underscore
   separators as well.

g. "suffix"
   The part of the filename after the version.
   e.g. Original URL: http://www.domain.tld/dir/subdir/filename-1.2.3.tar.gz
        suffix: .tar.gz

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: May be case-sensitive (depending on server's configuration).

h. "comment"
   Notes on the particular resource for that row.

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: Optional. Freeform; any text in allowed charset is OK.

i. "last_fetched"
   Depending on flags, the date of the last successful check, the last
   successful fetch, or the latest of either (or neither if 'N'/'n' etc. are
   specified as flags). If never checked/fetched/etc., then 'NEVER' will be
   used (this is the default entry).

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches, mirrors.
   RESTRICTIONS: If not 'NEVER', it will use 'Unix Epoch Time'.

j. "flags"
   Additional options controlling fetching of the resource. See "III. Flags".

   PRESENT IN: sources, patches.
   RESTRICTIONS: See "III. Flags".


2. Patches
   The columns in the 'patches' table are identical to the ones in 'sources',
   with the exception of the "package" column- multiple patches may be
   specified for a particular package.


3. Mirrors
   The 'mirrors' table is largely identical to the 'patches' table, with one
   key difference- there is no "flags" column. This is because a mirror is
   only even used if the 'M'/'m' flags are specified, and automatically by
   design inherits the flags of the same entry in 'sources'. Multiple sources
   for the same package may be provided; they will be tried in order they are
   returned (sorted by "id").


4. Checksums
   Checksums are entirely optional, and only need to be entered if the 'C'/'c'
   flags are specified for the source/patch. Largely the columns are the same
   as the 'sources' and 'patches' tables' columns, but with several new
   columns:

a. "type"
   What source to be applied to. Multiple checksums may be applied per type
   (i.e. If you have three patches and the patch is flagged for a checksum
   comparison, then all checksums matching the same "package", "type", and
   "version" will be tried). If no matching checksums are found and a checksum
   flag ('C'/'c') was applied, the check will fail and the source will return
   an error.

   RESTRICTIONS: Must be either 'sources' or 'patches'.

b. "hash"
   If a hash is supplied, then the URL/URI constructors ("protocol","urlbase",
   "file_prefix","suffix") are ignored and the hash given directly in this
   column will be used instead. If no "hash" is provided AND no valid URL/URI
   construction occurs AND the check flag was applied ('C'/'c'), then the
   check will fail and the source will return an error.


_III. FLAGS_

A. "Flags?"
   Flags are a way of controlling/defining certain behaviour of the source
   checking/fetching/etc. They allow adding attributes to certain resources
   without restructuring the entire database, allowing for independent changes
   to be implemented in the actual script without needing any database rebuild,
   reindexing, etc. One can even easily implement their own flags, as their
   behaviour is defined by the script itself.


B. Valid Flags

Currently at the time of this spec version, the following flags are valid:

_______________________________________________________________________________

|	FLAG	ACTION		BEHAVIOUR				      |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	a	Anomalous	This source uses a non-standard (or "weird"   |
|				  way of handling version numbers that isn't  |
|				  supported yet. Currently just implies 'n',  |
|				  but this may change in future releases.     |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	A	Always		Like 'a', but never removed (persistent).     |
|		Anomalous						      |
|									      |
|	c	Check Only	Only check for a new version (and if found,   |
|				  update the version in the DB); do not fetch.|
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	C	Always Check	Like 'c', but never removed (persistent).     |
|									      |
|	e	Extra		"Long" versioning. May use version numbers    |
|				  that are longer than Semantic Versioning    |
|				  (e.g. '1.2.3.4' instead of '1.2.3').	      |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	S	Always Extra	Like 's', but never removed (persistent).     |
|									      |
|	f	Fetch Only	Only fetch the current source, do not check   |
|				  for a new version (only "last_fetched" will |
|				  be updated in the DB).		      |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	F	Always Fetch	Like 'f', but never removed (persistent).     |
|									      |
|	m	Mirrored	Use a corresponding mirror instead of the     |
|				  primary source (make sure an entry with the |
|				  same "package" field is in the 'mirrors'    |
|				  table, or else this will fail).	      |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	M	Always		Like 'm', but never removed (persistent).     |
|		Mirrored						      |
|									      |
|	n	Never/Neither	Ignore for this run- do not fetch, do not     |
|				  check for a new version.		      |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	N	Always Never	Like 'n', but never removed (persistent).     |
|									      |
|	o	Obsolete	Obsolete. Was once a package to be included   |
|				  in checks/fetches, but is no longer.	      |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	O	Always		Like 'o', but never removed (persistent).     |
|		Obsolete						      |
|									      |
|	s	Short		"Short" versioning. May use version numbers   |
|				  that are shorter than Semantic Versioning   |
|				  (e.g. '1.2' instead of '1.2.3').	      |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	S	Always Short	Like 's', but never removed (persistent).     |
|									      |
|	x	Checksum	Compare downloaded file against a given       |
|				  checksum ("checksum" column). Make sure a   |
|				  checksum entry is given for the source,     |
|				  otherwise this will fail.		      |
|				  Removed on next run.			      |
|									      |
|	X	Always		Like 'x', but never removed (persistent).     |
|		Checksum						      |
